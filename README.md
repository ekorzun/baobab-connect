## Documentation

This library contains two functions â€“ `root` and `connect`. 

### root

The `root` method aims at passing a baobab tree through context so that other components (branches/containers/controllers) may use it. Typically, your app's top-level component will probably contains a root defintion.

```javascript
import Baobab from 'baobab'
import {root} from 'baobab-connect'
const tree = new Baobab({foo: {bar: 'baz'}})
root(tree) // that's it!
```

### connect

The `connect` bound to cursors, get their data from the tree given by the root.

Here is an example of displaying `foo.bar` value of our tree created at previous step:

```javascript
import connect from 'baobab-connect'

@connect({
  bar: 'foo.bar'
})
const BarComponent = ({bar}) => <span>{bar}</span>
export default BarComponent
```
